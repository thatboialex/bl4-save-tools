# Level XP Requirements
Figuring out functions to describe the level XP requirements with reasonable accuracy.

Level and XP values should match to avoid visual bugs with in-game counters.\
Setting XP _below_ the expected value for a given level will cause some sort of integer overflow in the GUI counter and it will not show the correct value until you earn enough XP to be back in line with your level's expected range.

XP required for **Character level 50** is `3430227`\
XP required for **Character level 60** is `5714893`\
XP required for **Specialization level 701** (enough to max all trees) is `7431910510`

## Research

**3 important numbers for this research:**
- **Level** - the level of the character/specialization.
- **Level-up XP** - the XP required to reach the next level. I catalog this under the level being reached.
- **Total XP** - the cummulative total of all XP earned (sum of all "level-up" values)

**Data collections:**
- [Character XP](../data/xp_character.csv)
- [Specialization XP](../data/xp_specialization.csv)

### Level-up (net) XP
The game tells us how many XP points we've earned since our last level up and how many net points from the current level are required for the next. This info can be combined with the current total XP in your save file to determine the total XP requirement for both the current and next level.

Ex.\
A character is level 24 with 441675 total XP points (find this near the top of the save file)\
They are at 1954/53192 for the next level-up (find this in-game under the Skills tab)\

From that we can calculate the required total XP for both level 24 and 25, plus we also have the net XP for `24->25`.\
**24:** `439721 = 441675 - 1954`\
**25:** `492913 = 441675 - 1954 + 53192`

We can systematically save-edit to inch upward through each total XP threshold.

Note: It seems like the first few levels (1-4 do not follow the same pattern, so I discard them when approximating the curve)

### How can we predect XP required for a given level?
To predict the XP required for a given level, we can fit a mathematical curve to the collected data points using NumPy’s polyfit function. This function finds the best-fitting polynomial (curve) of a specified degree for our data.

For example, a cubic polynomial (degree 3) has the form:

    XP = a * level³ + b * level² + c * level + d

By passing our level and XP data to np.polyfit(levels, xp, 3), we obtain the coefficients a, b, c, and d that best fit the actual XP requirements. We can then use this formula to estimate the total XP needed for any level, even those not explicitly listed in our data.

In practice:
1. We collect XP data for as many levels as possible.
2. We use Python math libraries to fit cubic curves to this data.
3. The resulting formulas allow us to predict XP requirements with reasonable accuracy.
4. Add a safety margin to estimates to ensure 

**Note:** I don't include leve 1-10 in my calculations - they seem to be adjusted manually and throw off the curves.
